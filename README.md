# Confluent Kafka Output Port Template

- [Overview](#overview)
- [Usage](#usage)

## Overview

Use this template to automatically create an Output Port based on an Apache Kafka topic.

### What's a Template?

A Template is a tool that helps create components inside Witboost. Templates help establish a standard across the organization. This standard leads to easier understanding, management and maintenance of components. Templates provide a predefined structure so that developers don't have to start from scratch each time, which leads to faster development and allows them to focus on other aspects, such as testing and business logic.

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.witboost.com/docs/p1_user/p6_advanced/p6_1_templates/#getting-started).

### What's an Output Port?

An Output Port refers to the interface that a System uses to provide data to other components or systems within the organization. The methods of data sharing can range from APIs to file exports and database links.

## Usage

To get information on how to use this template, refer to this [document](./docs/index.md).

### Component Testing

To verify the component before deploying it along with the System, the component needs to be tested against a CUE Policy defined for [Confluent Kafka Output Port](./policies/confluent_kafka_output_port.cue). This policy needs to be defined inside the **Governance** section of the Witboost Platform.

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.witboost.com/docs/p1_user/p5_managing_policies/p5_1_overview).
