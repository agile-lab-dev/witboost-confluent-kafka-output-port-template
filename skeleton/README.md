## Overview

Use this template to automatically create a Confluent Kafka Output Port.

### What's an Output Port?

An Output Port refers to the interface that a System uses to provide data to other components or systems within the organization. The methods of data sharing can range from APIs to file exports and database links.

### Confluent Kafka

Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed streaming system used for stream processing, real-time data pipelines, and data integration at scale. Originally created to handle real-time data feeds at LinkedIn in 2011, Kafka quickly evolved from a messaging queue to a full-fledged event streaming platform, capable of handling over one million messages per second, or trillions of messages per day.

Founded by the original creators of Apache Kafka, Confluent provides the most comprehensive Kafka tutorials, training, services, and support. Confluent also offers fully managed, cloud-native data streaming services built for any cloud environment, ensuring scalability and reliability for modern data infrastructure needs.
